# RIOT DATAS

Welcome to the RIOT DATAS project! This application is currently in its early stages and is designed to display items related to the popular game, League of Legends. As development progresses, our goal is to evolve this into a more comprehensive app.

## Current Features

At the moment, the app provides functionality to display various in-game items. However, we have ambitious plans to expand its capabilities in the future.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Material-UI (MUI) Components**: A React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design.

## API Integration

We rely on the Riot Games API to fetch and display data related to League of Legends. You can find more information about the Riot Games API [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis).
